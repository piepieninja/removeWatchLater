# Remove Watch Later

**IMPORTANT NOTE: **
This doesn't work on the main watch later page, you must select *EDIT* on the watch later page. Then run this script in your browsers console. 

made this really quick so that I can removed videos I've seen
from my watch later list.

The cutoff for what to remove is the 'watchpercent' variable at the top.
